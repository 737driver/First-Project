      <h1>International Preterist Association</h1>

      <h2>What is a Preterist View?</h2>

      <div class="container">

        </div>

        <p class="p1">
          “Preterist” means past in fulfillment, and “Futurist” means future in
          fulfillment. Preterist basically means the opposite of Futurist.
          Futurists believe most end-time prophecies (especially the big three
          events — the Second Coming, Resurrection, and Judgment) are yet to be
          fulfilled. Preterists believe that most or all of Bible Prophecy
          (especially the big three events) has already been fulfilled in Christ
          and the on-going expansion of His Eternal Kingdom. Many Futurists do
          not really believe that Christ has been successful in fully
          establishing His Kingdom. They think it was indefinitely postponed
          when the Jews rejected and crucified Jesus.
        </p>

        <p class="p2">
          Bible prophecy can be understood, but Futurist views have fallen far
          short for many reasons: their extreme physical/literalizing approach,
          their seeming inability to distinguish between figurative and literal
          language, and their failure to properly take into account the
          historical-grammatical-cultural context of the prophecies
          (specifically what they meant to their original audience). Even the
          most difficult prophetic passage comes alive when approached properly.
          It is time to look at some alternatives, and the Preterist view is a
          great place to start.

          <p class="p3">
            When Was Jesus Due? What did Christ say about the TIME of His
            coming? He said he would return in that first century generation,
            before “some of those standing there tasted death” (Matt. 10:23;
            Matt. 16:27,28; Matt. 24:34). Did you ever wonder why the First
            Century Christians expected Jesus to come in their lifetime, and how
            they got that expectation? Take a look at the extreme sense of
            urgency and imminency in these passages: James 5:8,9; 1 Pet. 4:7;
            Matt. 10:23; Matt. 16:27,28; Matt. 24:34. These verses have always
            troubled Bible students, and have been used by liberal theologians
            to attack the inspiration of Scripture. They reason that these
            passages were not fulfilled when they were supposed to be (the first
            century generation), so Jesus and the NT writers failed in their
            predictions and were therefore not inspired. But these verses point
            to Christ’s coming in some sense in connection with the Fall of
            Jerusalem at 70 AD.
          </p>

          <p class="p4">
            So, Jesus’ predictions were fulfilled. He did not fail, nor do we
            need to engage in theological gymnastics to try to explain-away the
            seeming delay or postponement of His return. It happened right on
            schedule. Many theologians know that the destruction of Jerusalem in
            70 AD was important in God’s scheme of redemption, but never
            understood its full significance. It has to do with the consummation
            of the plan of redemption. The final events of the redemptive drama
            came to pass in the first century within the apostles’ generation
            (before A.D. 70). Christ’s kingdom is here now. Paradise has been
            restored in Christ (for our afterlife in heaven above). Christ has
            conquered all His enemies and has given us His Eternal Kingdom, “of
            the increase of which there shall be no end” (Isaiah 9:6-7).
